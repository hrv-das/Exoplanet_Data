# Exoplanet_Data
Use the exoplanet data (‘exodata.tab') and do the following:  
    a. Calculate the mean, median, mode and standard deviation (𝜎) of log g of stars  
    b. Plot the log g, and line showing the solar log g, mean, 1𝜎 and 2𝜎  
    c. Plot the histogram of log g and comment on the distribution shape  
    d. Do the same (a,b,c) for Teff and Stellar ages  

Use scatter plot (in python) to display a) Teff vs log g for stars with 3500 ≤ Teff ≤ 6500 b) Planet mass vs 
stellar metallicity [Fe/H]. Interpret your results. This data is also available in exodata.tab file. c) Planet radius 
vs Planet mass  

For stars with 3500 ≤ Teff ≤ 6500, compute the Spearman r correlation coefficient for the following data pairs:  
     a. (Teff, log g), where Teff is the effective temperature of exoplanets hosting stars and log g is the surface 
gravity.
b. (MP, Fe/H] , where MP is the planet mass (in Jupiter mass Units) and Fe/H is the metallicity of the 
parent star.
c. (Rp, Mp), where Rp is planet radius and Mp is the planet mass
