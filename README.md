# Exoplanet_Data
1. We have used the exoplanet data (‘exodata.tab') and did the following:  
    a. Calculated the mean, median, mode and standard deviation (𝜎) of log g of stars  
    b. Plotted the log g, and line showing the solar log g, mean, 1𝜎 and 2𝜎  
    c. Plotted the histogram of log g and comment on the distribution shape  
    d. Did the same (a,b,c) for Teff and Stellar ages    

2. We have used scatter plot (in python) to display a) Teff vs log g for stars with 3500 ≤ Teff ≤ 6500 b) Planet mass vs 
stellar metallicity [Fe/H]. This data is also available in 'exodata.tab' file. c) Planet radius 
vs Planet mass  

3. For stars with 3500 ≤ Teff ≤ 6500, compute the Spearman r correlation coefficient for the following data pairs:  
     a. (Teff, log g), where Teff is the effective temperature of exoplanets hosting stars and log g is the surface 
         gravity.  
     b. (MP, Fe/H] , where MP is the planet mass (in Jupiter mass Units) and Fe/H is the metallicity of the 
         parent star.  
     c. (Rp, Mp), where Rp is planet radius and Mp is the planet mass
